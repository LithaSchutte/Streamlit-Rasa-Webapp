{
  "Country": "There is no strong correlation between the name of a country and life expectancy, rather, life expectancy is influenced by a variety of other socio-economic factors within any country",
  "Year": "Life expectancy tends to change over the years, but over the past years there has been no significant change, but if we would consider historical data, the correlation would be stronger.",
  "Fertility_Rate": "Fertility rate has a strong negative correlation with life expectancy. This is because for a higher fertility rate, with  the same population size, it would imply a higher mortality rate. In addition, it's more common for developed countries to have high fertility rates and more often than not, developed countries tend to have low fertility rates.",
  "Urban_Population_Percent": "Urban population percentage has a strong positive correlation with life expectancy, even though urbanisation contributes to health risk factors, it also implies better access to healthcare.",
  "Total_Population": "There is no strong correlation between the total population size and life expectancy.",
  "Water_Access_Percent": "Water access has a strong positive correlation with life expectancy.",
  "Unemployment_Rate": "Unemployment rate has a relatively low correlation with life expectancy, as the global average is not very high at 5%",
  "Sanitary_Expense_Per_GDP": "Sanitary expenses as a percentage of GDP have a positive correlation with life expectancy, as higher spending typically reflects better infrastructure and access to sanitation facilities.",
  "Life_Expectancy_Female": "Female life expectancy and general life expectancy is interconnected, and therefore the correlation is very strong, with female life expectancy tending to be a few years above the average.",
  "Life_Expectancy_Male": "Male life expectancy and general life expectancy is interconnected, and therefore the correlation is very strong, with male life expectancy tending to be a few years below the average.",
  "Infant_Deaths": "Infant deaths have a strong negative correlation with life expectancy, as higher infant mortality rates reduce the average lifespan within a population.",
  "GDP_Per_Capita": "GDP per capita has a strong positive correlation with life expectancy, as higher income levels are associated with better access to healthcare, education, and nutrition.",
  "Hospital_Beds_Per_1000": "The number of hospital beds per 1000 people has a positive, albeit weak, correlation with life expectancy, as it reflects the capacity of a healthcare system to provide care.",
  "Female_Population": "There is no strong correlation between the female population size and life expectancy.",
  "Male_Population": "There is no strong correlation between the male population size and life expectancy.",
  "Alcohol_Consumption_Per_Capita": "Alcohol consumption per capita has a complex correlation with life expectancy, as moderate consumption might not negatively impact health, while excessive consumption has a strong negative correlation. Generally alcohol consumption has a rather positive correlation with life expectancy as it also linked to other variables such as higher GDP.",
  "Immunization_Rate": "Immunization rates have a strong positive correlation with life expectancy, as higher rates reduce the prevalence of preventable diseases.",
  "Sanitary_Expense_Per_Capita": "Sanitary expenses per capita have a positive correlation with life expectancy, as they reflect investments in health and hygiene infrastructure.",
  "CO2_Exposure_Percent, ": "The data shows that CO2 exposure percent has a positive correlation with life expectancy, but this should not be misinterpreted and it's important to consider that higher CO2 rates are directly linked to urbanization and a higher GDP which both contribute to better health infrastructure.",
  "Air_Pollution": "The data indicates that air pollution has a positive correlation with life expectancy, but this should not be misinterpreted and it's important to consider that air pollution is directly linked to urbanization and a higher GDP which both contribute to better health infrastructure.",
  "Labour_Force_Total,": "The total labor force does not have a strong direct correlation with life expectancy but may indirectly influence it through economic productivity and social stability.",
  "Tuberculosis_Per_100000": "Tuberculosis rates per 100,000 people have a strong negative correlation with life expectancy, as high rates indicate poor healthcare and living conditions.",
  "Suicide_Rate_Percent": "Suicide rates have no significant relationship with life expectancy",
  "Obesity_Rate_Percent": "Overweight and obesity rates have a complex correlation with life expectancy as it tends to be positive in certain contexts, often due to better healthcare and living conditions in economically developed countries where overweight people are more common. Additionally, the \"obesity paradox\" suggests that in some illnesses, slightly overweight individuals might have better survival rates. However, obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases like diabetes and heart conditions, reduces quality of life, and strains healthcare systems. While this statistical correlation exists, maintaining a healthy weight is essential for overall health and well-being.",
  "Underweight_Rate_Percent": "Underweight rates have a negative correlation with life expectancy, as undernutrition contributes to poor health outcomes and higher mortality rates.",
  "Overweight_Rate_Percent": "Overweight and obesity rates have a complex correlation with life expectancy as it tends to be positive in certain contexts, often due to better healthcare and living conditions in economically developed countries where overweight people are more common. Additionally, the \"obesity paradox\" suggests that in some illnesses, slightly overweight individuals might have better survival rates. However, obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases like diabetes and heart conditions, reduces quality of life, and strains healthcare systems. While this statistical correlation exists, maintaining a healthy weight is essential for overall health and well-being.",
  "Safe_Water_Access_Percent": "Water access has a strong positive correlation with life expectancy, as it reduces the prevalence of waterborne diseases and improves overall health."
