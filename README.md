# Project Description

This app focuses on global health development by leveraging regression models to predict life expectancy across different\
countries. By analyzing various socio-economic, environmental, and healthcare-related factors, the app provides insights\
into how these variables influence life expectancy. The app aims to support data-driven decision-making in global health\
initiatives, offering valuable predictions that can guide policymakers and researchers in improving public health outcomes\
worldwide. The app also contains a chatbot that is aimed at making information more accessible to user and to improve the\
user experience.


### Key Features
